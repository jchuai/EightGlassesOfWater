# EightWaterApp
EightWater iOS App, written in Swift

This app is based on the tutorial about CoreGraphics.

[Core Graphics Tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/90690/modern-core-graphics-with-swift-part-1/)

The tutorial is strongly recommended for those who want to learn iOS CoreGraphics. It's quite easy to understand and the app demo is very beautiful.

I add local storage strategy to store user's data. And I also add local notification to remind user to drink water for next time.
